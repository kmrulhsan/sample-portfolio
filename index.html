            <h3>My Passion about Gaming & e-Sports</h3>
            <p>From my childhood gaming was like a entertaining thing for me. But after I grew up I thought about playing professionally. I did play call of duty for a organization for 2 months.Then I switched to valorant because that game was offering me what I was looking for.Now I am looking for a new organization to hire me.</p>
